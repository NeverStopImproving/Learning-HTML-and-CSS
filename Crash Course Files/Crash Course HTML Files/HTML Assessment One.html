        Create the heading for the exercise website, this can be done using either the strong tag, the <b> tag, or
        using span. When using span, we would need to create some sort of CSS to make the text bold though

        <p>I'm excited to eventually learn Flask!</p>
        <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org//">Here is a link to the official Flask Website</a>

        <p>Here is a picture of a puppy</p>
        <img src="../puppy.jpg" alt="No Image Was Found">

        <p>Here are three reasons Flask is cool</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Very Simple</li>
            <li>Lots of available add ons</li>
            <li>Create a website in a few minutes</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Bonus: Optional Extra Credit</h2>
        <p>Can you figure out how to make a picture a link?</p>

        <!--
        This anchor tag uses an image as the link to a specific page, this allows the user to select the image
        and then that image will take them to the href.
        -->
